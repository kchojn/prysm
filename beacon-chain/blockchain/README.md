# Attestation Verification Metrics System

## Overview

This solution implements a metrics collection system for tracking attestation verification performance in Prysm beacon
nodes.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **AttestationMetricsCollector Interface**
    - Defines the contract for recording attestation verification outcomes
    - Provides methods for recording successes and failures
    - Handles epoch transitions and metrics retrieval

2. **Thread-safe MetricsCollector Implementation**
    - Uses mutex for thread safety
    - Tracks:
        - Success/failure counts
        - Failure reasons with counts
        - Current epoch
        - Success rate calculations
    - Provides atomic operations for concurrent access

3. **Integration Points**
    - Integrated in `reportEpochMetrics` in blockchain service
    - Hooks into existing epoch boundary processing
    - Leverages existing prometheus metrics infrastructure

### Why This Approach?

1. **Location Choice**
    - Integrated into `reportEpochMetrics` because:
        - Already handles epoch-level metrics
        - Has access to necessary state information
        - Natural point for epoch-boundary processing
        - Minimizes code changes and complexity

2. **Data Structure Design**
    - Separate interface and implementation for:
        - Better testing capabilities
        - Clear contract definition
        - Future extensibility
        - Dependency injection

### What could I improve?

- Separate a better place for metrics. We could move this a level up to `metrics`, but I decided to put it here because:
    - “Outputs a summary of the collected data at the end of each epoch.” The requirement indicated a place as close as
      possible to the end of each epoch.
    - Doesn't interfere too much with the code, no complex changes needed.

    - When handling more attestation verifications (e.g., sync module), a shared interface and metrics with appropriate
      namespace would be useful.

- error handling. I added base error handlers, for critical components. This can be extended to a higher level (I didn't
  want to disturb the readability of the code, with not much code interference)

- adding configuration, making metrics collector service with context support
- adding limitation:
    - length of reasons
    - watching for overflow
    - checking if the collector works
- prysm uses tracing, so this can be added to the tracking too
